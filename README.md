writing symbols boot.sym

TODO:
	strings are probably not handled correctly
	defintly not using the map bit right
	DAC/EAC pseudo instructions do not work right at all
	i still dont know what how the ** operator is supposed to work
	i need to be able to import library symbols but i dont know them
	

good stuff:
	almost full compliance with the original 810 assembler so the manual can be used... kinda
	works as a two-pass assembler (thank you lambda)
	

stuff to know:
	the asm format is quite strict and based on the original punch card limitations
labels can only be 4 characters, must start with a letter, the opcode column is also
*always* 4 bytes wide before its arguments and arguments have a limited lengths and on line
comments are part of the "line" and start at  offset 25 on each line and only the DATA
pseudo opcode can span the two
